# Game of Life

## Overview

The "Game of Life" is an Android application that emulates Conway's Game of Life, a famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This simulation demonstrates the evolution of patterns in a grid of cells based on specific rules governing their status changes in each generation.

The Game of Life operates on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell can either be alive or dead. The status of each cell evolves in each generation based on the statuses of its neighboring cells. This simple simulation illustrates emergent behaviors and complex patterns that arise from straightforward rules.

## Key Features

- **Cellular Automaton Simulation:** The application simulates the evolution of the Game of Life, providing a visual representation of evolving patterns.
- **Random Initialization:** The initial grid configuration is set with random live and dead cells to initiate the simulation.
- **Continuous Simulation:** The app demonstrates a continuous and periodic update of the cell grid.
- **GitHub Repository Link:** The source code for the application is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aj3322/GameOFLife).
